# Graph algoritms notebooks
___________________________
### A bunch of graph algoritms implemented in Python. Designed to be viewed in GitHub.
- [x] __Breadth-first search__ - it explores graph layer by layer
- [x] __Depth-first search__ - it explores graph by going to the depth of the first branch
  - both recursive and loop method
