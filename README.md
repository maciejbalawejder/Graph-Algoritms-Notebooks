# Graph algorithms notebooks
___________________________
### A bunch of graph algoritms implemented in Python. Designed to be viewed in GitHub.
- [x] __Breadth-first search__ - it explores graph layer by layer
  - [x] Shortest path in the maze using BFS 
- [x] __Depth-first search__ - it explores graph by going to the depth of the first branch
  - [x] Both recursive and loop method
